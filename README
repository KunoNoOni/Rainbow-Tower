Rainbow Tower is a retro RPG in the vain of dragon warrior, with a plot borrowed from Azure Dreams in so much as I have a town with a tower next to it. The plot of the game is to clear the tower, and free the town.

As of yet work has not begun on this game. Hopefully I will begin it soon, most likely after the platformer I am working on now.
